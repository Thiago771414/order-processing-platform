# Live Demo

Web interface deployed on Netlify:

https://thiagoreislimasds2.netlify.app/

⚠ Important note

The backend was originally deployed on Heroku, but Heroku discontinued the free tier.

Because of that, the cloud demo currently loads **only the frontend interface**.

The complete backend implementation and mobile application source code are fully available in this repository and the full system can be executed locally.

---

# Overview

This project simulates a **food delivery ordering system**, where users place orders through a mobile or web interface.

The system processes requests through a backend service responsible for order management and delivery queue handling.

When a delivery is completed, the order is removed from the processing queue.

The project demonstrates how a **multi-client architecture** interacts with a centralized backend service.

---

# Engineering Problem

Modern delivery platforms must handle multiple interaction layers:

• mobile ordering interfaces  
• web dashboards  
• backend order processing  
• real-time order queues  

Without a structured architecture, order management systems can suffer from:

• inconsistent order state  
• synchronization issues between clients  
• queue management problems  
• UI and API integration failures  

This project demonstrates how a backend service can coordinate orders from multiple clients.

---

# Solution

The platform implements a **three-layer architecture**:

Mobile Application  
↓  
Backend API  
↓  
Order Processing and Delivery Queue  

Users can:

• select products  
• define delivery location  
• submit orders through the mobile interface  

The backend receives the request, stores the order, and manages the delivery lifecycle.

Once a delivery is completed, the order is removed from the queue.
